# ASSIGNMENT
Our project aims to develop a comprehensive Social Media Dashboard utilizing Django and React frameworks. This dashboard provides users with a centralized platform to manage their social media activities efficiently. 
Social Media Dashboard using Django and React:


Main Commands:
- **Create Django project:**
  ```bash
  django-admin startproject project_name
  ```

- **Create Django app:**
  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp app_name
  ```

- **Run Django development server:**
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- **Install React app (using create-react-app):**
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app frontend
  ```

- **Install necessary packages (Django):**
  ```bash
  pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers
  ```

- **Install necessary packages (React):**
  ```bash
  npm install axios
  ```

- **Initialize Git repository:**
  ```bash
  git init
  ```

- **Add remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
  ```

- **Push changes to remote repository:**

By combining the robustness of Django with the interactivity of React, our Social Media Dashboard empowers users to streamline their social media management tasks, enhance productivity, and optimize their online presence effectively.
